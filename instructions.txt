I am not able to change the location of all the indiviual folders as the log files are already
created and if i change them then I would have to train the model again will takes a lot of time.
So I have mentioned where all the components are located for your ease.


There is a 1) report pdf: Final_Project_642_Report
	   2) program files: main.py and Face_Detection_Daily_life_Scenes.py
	   3) image set: dataset folder has the image set
	   4) Auxillary files : the output and performnce metrics of the entire code can be seen in 2 
	      log files present in the log folder.


To run the two python files
uncomment the following two lines at the end of main.py file before training and comment it 
after training is done -
   
TrainData() 
TestData()

To train - 
python main.py -> ./logs/train_log.txt

To test on real images -
python Face_Detection_Daily_Life_Scenes.py -> ./logs/test_log.txt
